Best practices on how to be efficient with Haskell in production.

In a sense, this is a set of blog posts that give best practices on common things in Haskell that are not straight forward.
They serve as help for Wasp developers/contributors but also as general source of knowledge.
One day, if this handbook becomes good enough, we can look into elevating it into documentation effort on the level of whole Haskell community, beyond Wasp.

All of the posts in this repo should be focusing on the following:
- Must be easy to understand, even for a beginner.
- If possible, should be opinionated about the best approache when there are multiple of them (it should still mention them all though).
- Must be rich with practical examples.
- Should be focusing on practical usage in real projects where juniors might be joining and we want them to be efficient soon after they join.
